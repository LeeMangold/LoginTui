# LoginTui

This is a simple ssh login banner UI. Rather than display text that just passes by, this will display a curses dialog box and give you an option to accept or reject. If you reject, the session is terminated.

## Requirements
**Install the "dialog" package**
 * apt install dialog (Debian / Ubuntu)
 * yum install dialog (RHEL / CentOS)

**Copy the script to your /etc/ssh/sshrc file** *(This probably doesn't exist yet)*
